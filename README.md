# Data-Driven Modeling of Microbial Inactivation
## Release Notes
 - This is a repository of code and literature data for our publication, Zhang et al. (2021), where we offer a systematic and generalizable pipeline for high-throughput development of microbial growth and inactivation models applicable to various types of datasets.
 - Our approach involves combined use of data-driven modeling and global sensitivity analysis to identify governing equations, governing process variables and their interactions effects. 
## Tutorial
 - Download the complete repository and run the runDDM4Inactivation.mlx file for a comprehensive step-by-step implementation of our approach in the form of a MATLABÂ® Live Script that generates all the results and figures found in the publication. 
 - Literature data used in this study is given in ExperimentalDataset.xlsx file.
